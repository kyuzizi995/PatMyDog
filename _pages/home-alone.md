<p>For the first few weeks it is advisable not to leave your dog alone at home for long durations. It is good if you make use of crates and chew toys while leaving for short durations. Do this several times a day for a week at least and observe the behaviour of the dog. Donâ€™t be overtly expressive about going or coming. You may trying keeping some soothing music on while you are away for a considerable duration.</p>
