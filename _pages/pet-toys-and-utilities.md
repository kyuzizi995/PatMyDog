<p>Provide the pet with plenty of chew toys that are free of harmful chemicals.</p><p>It not only keeps them occupied but also prevents them from chewing up on other harmful items and ruining household stuff.</p><p>Make sure you have all the utilities such as dog leash, dog crate, food dishes, blanket if needed.</p>
